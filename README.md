# .NET Journey with Exercism

Welcome to my .NET journey! This repository documents my progress as I learn and practice C# using the exercises provided by [Exercism](https://exercism.io/).

## About

I am embarking on a journey to master .NET, starting with the foundational exercises in learning C# offered by Exercism. This repository will serve as a log of my progress, showcasing the solutions to various coding challenges and the knowledge I gain along the way.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each representing a different exercise or project. Each folder contains the following:

- **Exercise Files**: The main code files where the solutions are implemented.
- **Test Files**: Unit tests to verify the correctness of the solutions.
- **README.md**: A brief description of the exercise and any relevant notes.

## Getting Started

To follow along or run the exercises on your local machine, you'll need to have the following installed:

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Cloning the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```git 
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```

### Running the Exercises

1. Navigate to the exercise folder you want to run.
2. Open the solution file (`.sln`) in Visual Studio or the folder in Visual Studio Code.
3. Restore the NuGet packages (if necessary) by running:

```cmd
dotnet restore
```

4. Build the solution:

```cmd
dotnet build
```

5. Run the tests to verify the solution:

```cmd
dotnet test
```
